 *
 * TODO since this still does violate our security assumptions, we should
 * consider making it development-time only, and turn it off in production.
 * Or better, adapt it to stop using top-level state.
 *
 * The condition it checks for is that, within one incarnation, the
 * `provide` is never called twice with the same `mapStore`
 * and the same `key`. For a given `mapStore` and `key`, there should be at
 * most one `provide` call but any number of `get` calls.
 *
 * When the `mapStore` is baggage, for purposes of upgrade, then we
 * expect `provide` to be called with the same `baggage` and `key`
 * (and some `makeValue`) in each incarnation of that vat.
 * In the incarnation that first registers this `baggage`,`key` pair, the
 * `provide` will actually call the `makeValue`. The one `provide` call
 * for this pair in each succeeding incarnation will merely retrieve the value it
 * inherited from the previous incarnation. But even for this case, it should
 * only call `provide` for that pair once during that incarnation.

 * low cardinality, since we keep the bookkeeping to detect collisions
 * in normal language-heap memory. All the other baggage-oriented
 * `provide*` and `prepare*` functions call `provide`,

 *    * data "variables" for reestablishing the lexical scope, especially
 *      of singletons
 *    * named non-baggage collections at the leaves of the baggage tree.
 *
