 * Asks Zoe (via zcf) to rearrange the allocations among the seats

 * several constraints. If these constraints are all met, then the
 * reallocation happens atomically. Otherwise it does not happen
 * at all.
 *
 * The conditions
 *    * All the mentioned seats are still live -- enforced by ZCF.
 *    * No outstanding stagings for any of the mentioned seats.
 *      Stagings now deprecated in favor or atomicRearrange. To
 *      prevent confusion, for each reallocation, it can only be
 *      expressed in the old way or the new way, but not a mixture.
 *    * Offer safety -- enforced by ZCF.
 *    * Overall conservation -- enforced by ZCF.
 *    * The overall transfer is expressed as an array of `TransferPart`.
 *      Each individual `TransferPart` is one of
 *       - A transfer from a `fromSeat` to a `toSeat`.
 *         This is not needed for Zoe's safety, as Zoe does
           its own overall conservation check. Rather, it helps catch
           and diagnose contract bugs earlier.
 *       - A taking from a `fromSeat`'s allocation. See the `fromOnly`
           helper.
         - A giving into a `toSeat`'s allocation. See the `toOnly`
           helper.
 *
 * TODO(6679) Refactor `atomicRearrange`from being a helper into being
 * zcf's replacement for reallocate. It was made a helper during
 * the transition, to avoid interference with progress on Zoe durability.
 *
 * See the helpers below, `fromOnly`, `toOnly`, and `atomicTransfer`,
 * which will remain helpers. These helper are for convenience
 * in expressing atomic rearrangements clearly.
